change diagram so each path has its own color
future: paths with multiple interferences
ground truth (hand crafted):
	how to generate
	how to get distances to ground truth
	how to rank
	have one service to look at as the interesting one
	how many examples of ground truth would we have?
interference path -> reason could also be cascade
ranking: Where should I intervene? -> Might make assumption: Only look at interference, not cascade (future work)
Put temporal information on node instead of edge --> Use node2vec
What would change using TransE? --> Related Work
